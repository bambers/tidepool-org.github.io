#About the Tidepool Project

We are building an internet application platform and series of applications to help reduce the burden of managing Type 1 Diabetes. See [our web site](http://tidepool.org) for lots and lots of information about the project.


#How you can help

We're a nonprofit organization doing everything in the open. Open source, open business, and we need lots of help. [This document](HowToHelp.html) will give you a pretty detailed overview of the sorts of ways people can help. 

#Technical Documentation

We're beginning to organize the documentation and the projects in a way we hope other people will be able to find useful. 

The [Platform Overview](PlatformOverview.html) tries to explain our technical vision in the near term, with heavy emphasis on the things we're implementing right now. 

The [Server Architecture](ServerArchitecture.html) page tells how the many moving parts of our server system fit together. 

The [Server Data Organization](ServerDataOrganization.html) page explains how the various bits of server data is organized and how they relate to each other. It also has a set of use cases we try to keep in mind, but they're still sparse. They'll someday get a page of their own.

The [Tidepool Component List](TidepoolComponents.html) goes through a list of active repositories and summarizes what they're for and how they fit together. 

# This documentation site
All of this is a work in progress. If you find something particularly confusing, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tidepool-org.github.io/issues) with suggestions on how it could be clearer. Even better, if you think you can make it better, fork the [repository for this documentation site](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tidepool-org.github.io) and file a pull request for improvements. 

The site is using GitHub pages with Jekyll as the page generator. See README.md in the repository for how to get started. If you're comfortable with git and a text editor, it's pretty easy.
